# Clearance-Management-System
Our system assumes there is an existing database that contains student's and emmployee's information.
We have emulated the following users:
  For Staff:
      *passwords for all staff accounts is 'cldb'
      Admin: Username - A1
      Library: L96
      Dorm: D96
      Sports: S96
      Department: F96
      
  For Student:
      *passwords for all student accounts is 'add'
      student1 - TT/99/11
      student2 - TT/99/12
      student3 - TT/99/13
